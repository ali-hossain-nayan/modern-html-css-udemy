📘 My HTML & CSS Mini Projects – Course Assignments

After completing this course, I gained a much deeper understanding of HTML and CSS—far more than I ever had before.
Throughout the lessons, I worked on several challenges, and I tried my best to solve every task with my own logic and approach.

One thing I’m really proud of is that I completed four full assignments/projects, all with the same given UI layout, but I rewrote the structure and styling in my own way.
These projects helped me understand layout systems, visual design, responsiveness, and writing cleaner code from scratch.

Below, I’m sharing the live links, GitHub repositories, and short descriptions for each project.

🌟 1. Lumina Creative

A simple, clean, and fully responsive website built using pure HTML5 & CSS.
This project focuses on layout, spacing, visual appearance, and modern minimalist design.
It was a great beginner-friendly practice project for improving my structure and styling skills.
